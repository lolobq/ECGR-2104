# ECGR-2104
Contains the projects from my ECGR 2104 Computer Engineering II class. All code is written in C++ with some C header files.

## 1. Flight Tracker
I practiced separating code into multiple files and using header files. This program provided the user with a pre-defined list of departures and destinations and allowed them to choose each location. Based on the two locations, the haversine formula was used to calculate the distance between locations. Based on a constant flight speed, the flight time was calculated for the user.

## 2. Nutrition Tracker
I practiced creating classes and separating class code between cpp files and header files. This program gave the user a pre-defined menu of food items to choose from. The program loops, allowing the user to choose multiple food items until they choose to be done selecting items. After this, the total macronutrients of the food are calculated. The user is notified if their daily nutrition intake exceeds the daily recommended amount.

## 3. Doubly Linked List
I practiced proper memory allocation by utilizing pointers and using constructors, desctructors, copy constructors, and overriding the copy assignment operator. This taught me how doubly linked lists work and more specifically, how to create one. 

## 4. Survival Game
I practice polymorphism and inheritance to create multiple "Land" classes within the survival game. I put together the rest of the skills I gained from the class to create a simple survival game.
